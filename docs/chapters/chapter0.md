## Introductions

Welcome! Below you’ll find all slides and instructions for the hands-on activities being held throughout the day. The site will remain up well after the event so you can refer back to the material at any time.

### Prerequisites

All attendees must have the NativeScript CLI installed, and all system requirements in place to develop for _either_ iOS or Android. If you haven’t already, complete the installation instructions using the link below.

* [Complete the NativeScript installation guide](https://nativescript-vue.org/)

Additionally, please also [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and then [install the editor’s NativeScript extension](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/visual-studio-code-extension#installation). You’ll be using NativeScript’s Visual Studio Code extension as you complete this guide.
